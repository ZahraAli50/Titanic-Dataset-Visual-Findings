# Titanic Dataset Insights

To gain insights from the Titanic dataset, I performed thorough exploratory data analysis. This included creating various plots and visualizations such as:

Distribution plots of age, fare, and passenger class

Bar plots comparing survival rates by gender and class

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Count plots for categorical features like embarkation port, gender, and siblings/spouses aboard

Boxplots to analyze feature distributions across survival outcomes
